# Nani-Doko-Tabeyou
A website where you curate a list of your favorite restaurants, or restaurants you want to try, and the type of food they serve. You can choose the type of food you want to eat (or have the site randomly suggest one to you) from a drop down list and the site will show you a restaurant from your list that serves that food.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I started by writing the HTML, I made a drop down list and later used JavaScript to make a call to the API and populate the list with types of food. When a type of food is selected, boxes pop up under the upper section showing restaurants from your list that serves these foods. Javascript was also used to make an array of food types and randomly show one when the button is clicked.

## Optimizations
Make it fullstack.

## Lessons Learned:
calls to API, manipulating api data to build arrays and display them in the HTML, media queries in JavaScript for items that are displayed upon interaction with another item
